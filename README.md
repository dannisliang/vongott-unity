This project is an open source ARPG set in the world of Warren Spector's Deus Ex.

### The story
You wake up in an abandoned airport terminal in use by the NSF as a temporary base. You are the only test subject out of two to survive several mechanical and biological implant surgeries performed in a rushed emergency room setup in the washrooms of the terminal. You are greeted by the on-site surgeon and an NSF soldier who tell you that you are their latest advancement in their battle against oppression. Your first important task is to steal a shipment of vaccine from the government to distribute among citizens infected by the pandemmic virus "the grey death". Also, you have to fix their sewer problems, because nobody else wants to do it.

### The vision
We are trying to fill out the plot holes in the beginning of the main story of Deus Ex. How did the NSF capture the ambrosia shipment? How did they take over the statue? What the hell was the point of the NSF commander Leo Gold being left in such an obvious place, just waiting to get captured and interrogated? There will be some major branching off from the original story, but the goal is to stay consistent with the lore of the entire franchise. We are considering the plot a calssic cyberpunk adventure and trying to further underline the dark and bizarre humour that can be found in Deus Ex.

### The gameplay
There isn't a lot up for discussion when doing this type of game. It will be a first person shooter with the option to go into third person mode while not wielding a gun. The augmentation system will more closely resemble a classic RPG scheme, categorising biological augmentations as abilities and mechanical augmentations as skills. Mechanical augmentations can in some cases be combined to perform special moves. The level design should take lessons from Deus Ex, but as a rule not directly copy it. There should generally be several ways to approach any situation that you come across as a player.

### What's there?

- A reimagined augmentation system.
- Flexible, node-based dialogue and quest system
- Adaptive A.I. behaviour that aims to vaguely resemble that of Deus Ex, but surpassing it in a few ways.
- Path finding using navmeshes, waypoints and automatically generated grids
- A fully capable SDK for building levels, converations, quests and other game content
- Rough first scene, story outline and script
- Concept art for some key characters

### Which tools are being used currently?

- Unity3D
- Blender + ZBrush
- Photoshop + GIMP
- Renoise + Audacity
