### What?
This is a Deus Ex fangame. It will be created with the help of OpenTools, which is being developed with Unity.

### Why?
Obviously, a lot of obsessive Deus Ex fandom goes into the equation, but there are reasonable arguments for making this from scratch, some of which are outlined in the "Design" page of the wiki.

### How?
1. Create an action RPG framework from scratch
2. Create a capable SDK to take advantage of this framework
3. Create tons of generic assets
4. Write the first chapter and create the required assets
5. Build the game with the SDK
6. Release the SDK and the game for free
