#### Welcome to The Vongott Chronicles project site
This is an open source parody game based on the original Deus Ex, in a similarly cyberpunky style and ARPG-esque gameplay. It takes place at the same time as the original story, but explores a different angle while poking some fun at it.

* Reimagined augmentation system, including both mechanical and biological
* Complex, node based dialogue system with visual editor
* Implements [OpenGUI](http://jeppezapp.com/opengui) for neat UI fanciness
