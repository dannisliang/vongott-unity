### Bio
After waking up in an NSF bunker for the 315th time (apparently), they have no idea where they are from or how they got there. All that they know from the NSF activists, who brought them to life, is that they have been reconstructed using counterfeit biomechanical implants, plus some stolen government nanotechnology. There will later appear to be sparse remnants of the past in their mind, and from the very beginning they display a distinct personality based on playful dark humor and cynicism. Their fighting skills are quite limited compared to other modern action game protagonists, as they have no field training at all. Their only advantage in a fight is their implants. This means that while they might deliver a powerful punch, run fast or jump high, they can't deliver action hero-type combos or scripted takedowns, as their advantage over the enemy isn't guaranteed.

### Personality
Cocky and playful, but cynical and with a complete disregard for human life by default. This fits well with JC Denton from the first Deus Ex game, but takes it one step further towards stone cold asshattery. To compare with other Deus Ex protagonists with a simple sentence, Adam Jensen might say "I believe you know better than to do that", Alex Denton might say "You can't do that!", JC Denton might say "I'll put a bullet in your face before you can do that", and this character would say "Go ahead! Let's see what happens!". This is of course hard to say, as their responses rely on player choice, but each character does seem to have a path throughout their games that "fit" them the best. Adam is the hero type, Alex has big morality issues with everyone else's actions, JC only barely gives a crap at all, and this character is a playful lunatic, akin to AgentX from the Deadpool comics. The reason why I am referencing Agent X is that while their backstories might be different, their introduction is similar. You have no idea who he is, but he displays a very distinct personality from the beginning, which is very enjoyable even if you are unfamiliar with his character basis.
