## Leo Gold

### Name
Leo Gold

### Sex
Male

### Bio
He is an NSF colonel, special operations. It's the "terrorist leader" JC interrogates in the first mission of Deus Ex 1. He has a bad habit of getting captured and interrogated, requireing rescue quite often. This isn't always entirely his own fault, as the main reason why he is still a member of the NSF is that he is a good scapegoat to leave behind on dangerous missions, as he knows close to none of the specifics of any given mission that he's on at the time.

### Personality
He is a flaming populist, often spouting idealistic phrases like "You can't fight ideas with bullets!" and more crazy uncle-type phrases such as "Ants are people too!". His temper and lack of strategic thought often makes him attempt investigation or even lethal action without the consent of his fellow NSF activists. His value as a scapegoat outweighs his liability as a lunatic, though.
