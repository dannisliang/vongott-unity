Scene 1: Tutorial ( NRF bunker 1 )
=====

( player is locked in a poorly crafted incubator )

( screen is black )

- Player: “Whuh?”
- Player: “Whoah?”

( sudden change to scene )

- You: “AAAARRRGGGHH!!!”
- Strange man: "Jesus man, calm down!”
- You: “What’s going on? What is this? I don’t even..”
- Strange man: “Relax, buddy, ok? You just woke up, that’s all.”
- You: “But.. I mean.. What? Have I... been awake before?”
- Strange man: “Well, technically, no.. or yes. It’s complicated. Take your pick, it doesn’t matter.”
- You: “But.. who am I?”
- Strange man: “Ehrm.. Your name is..”

( prompt: what is your name? )

- Strange man: “(player name)! Yeah, that’s it! Definitely didn’t just make that up!”
- You: “(player name).. OK. Seems legit...”
- Strange man: “And I'm Miguel. Let’s get you out of there and put you on a test run."
- Miguel: "Hopefully this will be the last time we have to do this..”
- (player name): "Did... did we do this earlier?”
- Miguel: “Yeah, but we have to fry your memory every time it fails."
- Miguel: "I have a good feeling about this one, though. 435th time’s the charm!”
- (player name): “...”

( the incubator turns to a test course )

( player is tipped out of the incubator )

- Miguel: "Now just try out the basics. Running, jumping, looking and crouching."
- Miguel: "This really should be no problem at all."
- Miguel: "Come on back and talk to me when you've gotten comfortable moving around."

( prompt: use [arrow keys] to move, press [space] to jump, [shift] to crouch and look around with your mouse )

- Miguel: "All right, let's make this a little more interesting.
- Miguel: "Take this gun and take out those barrels any way you want."

( prompt: use [left click] to shoot, [1-0] to change weapon, and [right click] to do a melee attack )

- Miguel: "Nice moves! It looks like my gut feeling was correct!"
- Miguel: "I better go tell the others. You can stay here and practice if you like."
- Miguel: "Come on upstairs when you're ready."

( prompt: you can adjust the controls to your liking in the options menu [esc] )
