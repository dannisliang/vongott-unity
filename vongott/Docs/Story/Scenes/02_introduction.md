### Head out
- Miguel: "For now, all you need to know is that there is a big ass plague going on."
- Miguel: "Everyone is dying around us, and we know who is responsible."
- Miguel: "These pigs have been synthesizing the chemical that causes the plague to spread..."
- Miguel: "...while also taking charge of distributing the cure to a select few."
- Miguel: "We know of a vaccine shipment that is ours for the taking, if we can first create a diversion..."
- Miguel: "...so you're going to help us occupy the Statue of Awesome and capture the shipment afterwards."
- (player name):

  2. "No way! I have no reason to help you at all."
  3. "Yes, sir!"
- Miguel:
  1. "Don't worry, my man."
  2. "I can kill you by flipping a switch, so don't think for a second that you have a choice."
  3. "That's the spirit!"
- Miguel: "I've taken the liberty of implementing some basic field training in your memory..."
- Miguel: "...it should be more than enough to complete this mission. Let's head out!"
