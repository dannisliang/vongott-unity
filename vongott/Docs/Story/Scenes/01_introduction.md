Scene 1: Introduction ( NSF Bunker )
=====

## Basement
( player is locked in a poorly crafted incubator )

( screen is black )

- You: “Whuh?”
- You: “Whoah?”

( sudden change to scene )

- You: “AAAARRRGGGHH!!!”
- Strange man: "Jesus man, calm down!”
- You: “What’s going on? What is this? I don’t even..”
- Strange man: “Relax, buddy, ok? You just woke up, that’s all.”
- You: “But.. I mean.. What? Have I... been awake before?”
- Strange man: “Well, technically, no.. or yes. It’s complicated. Take your pick, it doesn’t matter.”
- You: “But.. who am I?”
- Strange man: “Ehrm.. Your name is..”

( prompt: what is your name? )

- Strange man: “(player name)! Yeah, that’s it! Definitely didn’t just make that up!”
- You: “(player name).. OK. Seems legit, I guess.”
- Strange man: “And I'm Miguel. Let’s get you out of there and put you on a test run."
- Miguel: "Hopefully this will be the last time we have to do this..”
- (player name): "Did... did we do this earlier?”
- Miguel: “Yeah, but we have to fry your memory every time it fails."
- Miguel: "I have a good feeling about this one, though. 435th time’s the charm!”
- (player name): “...”

( the incubator turns to a test course )

( player is tipped out of the incubator )

- Miguel: "Now just try moving around. It should be no problem if my calibrations are good enough."
- Miguel: "Come on back and talk to me when you've gotten comfortable with your legs and whatnot."

( prompt: use [arrow keys] to move, press [space] to jump, [shift] to crouch and look around with your mouse )

- Miguel: "All right, let's make this a little more interesting."
- Miguel: "Here's a gun. Take out those barrels any way you want."

( prompt: use [left click] to shoot, [1-0] to change weapon, and [right click] to do a melee attack )

- Miguel: "Nice moves! It looks like my gut feeling was correct!"
- Miguel: "I better go tell the others. You can stay here and practice if you like."
- Miguel: "Come on upstairs when you're ready."

( prompt: you can adjust the controls to your liking in the options menu [esc] )

## Upstairs

  3. "Hi. I'm (player name)."
- Miguel:
  1. "Straight to the point, all right."
  2. "Calm down, cabron. You've been alive for 10 minutes and this is your attitude already?"
  3. "Good to see that you've calmed down, amigo."
- Miguel: "We are the National Revolutionst Front, and you work with us now."
- Miguel: "The bunker we are in now is one of our many hideouts."
- Miguel: "Feel free to look around and talk to some of your fellow activists."

  2. "Hey, give me some slack!"
  3. "I don't really like using my name here."
