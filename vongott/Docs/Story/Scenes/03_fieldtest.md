Scene 3: Field Test ( island_exterior ) 
=====

## Enter
( boat approaches the north dock, Marcel and player gets out )

- Marcel: "We want to see how you deal with this situation on your own, so you'll be going in alone. We will occupy this place once the coast is clear."
- Marcel: "Pick a weapon and incapacitate the guards any way you like."
- (player):
  1. “Just give me a stick. I'll manage.”
  2. "Hand over the assault rifle. I'll show you faggots how it's done."
  3. "I'll take the darts. No need to kill everyone."
- Marcel:
  1. "Very funny. I'll give you a tazer."
  2. "OK, big man. Don't trip over your huge cojones on the way."
  3. "Good thinking. The non-lethal approach makes us look better in any case."
- Marcel: "We have an informant here, Charlie Furben, who knows this place inside and out."
- Marcel: "If you want a few tips from him, tell him I sent you." 
- Marcel: "Now get moving. Vaya con dios."

## (optional)  Charlie Furben
- (player): "Hey..."
- Charlie: "Enough with the formalities. I know Marcel sent you. I know it all, man."
- (player):
  1. "What number am I thinking of right now?"
  2. "You smell like a cat's anus. What the hell have you been doing?"
  3. "Can you tell me how to get into the statue?"
- Charlie:
  1. "7. Moving on..."
  2. "I don't trust showers."
  3. "I knew you were going to say that!"
- Charlie: "There is a backdoor into the statue hidden behind a bush on the south east side of the island."
- Charlie: "My services are free of charge, but I can sell you some gear, if you are interersted."
- (player):
  1. "Sure. Let's have a look."
  2. "No thanks. I must be off."

## (optional) junkie
- (player): "Excuse me..."
- junkie: "AAAH! Go away! My bush! Mine!"
- (player):
  1. "I'm the cable guy. You called for me."
  2. "Get out of here before I spasticate you."
  3. "My apologies. I didn't know this bush was occupied."
- junkie:
  1. "I did? I'm sorry, my memory is terrible. The TV is in the bathroom."
  2. "I don't understand that word! Die!" (attack)
  3. "Grumble.. OK, I'll let you in for 10 moneys."
	- (player):
  	1. "Maybe later."
	2. "No way! I'd sooner kill you!"
	3. "Here you go."

## (npc) Guards
- Guard 1: "I just have a hard time believing that a tiny French terrorist group could have pulled off something so elaborate."
- Guard 2: "Listen man, it was in the tabloids and everything. What more do you want?"
- Guard 1: "A bit of critical thinking from the people I surround myself with would be nice..."
- Guard 2: "This thing had the most extensive news coverage I've seen in my life. The frog munchers did blow up the statue, period."
- Guard 2: "I mean it's no wonder they're pissed at us lately, they just finally had enough and took back their present."
- Guard 1: "Yeah, that does make sense... I just wonder how those sneaky little turds got away with it."
- Guard 2: "That's racist, man."

## (optional) Leonard
- Leonard: "I will take point from here, (player). We will change this world tonight."
- Leonard: "Bullets don't work on ideas! Or... hmm... I guess I have to work on that..."
- Leonard: "Anyway, we will divert attention from big brother while you capture the vaccine in the name of the people."
- (player):
  1. "You are so pretty."
  2. "Get lost, hippie."
  3. "Who are you?"
- Leonard:
  1. "Ehrm... Thanks..."
  2. "Don't be negative in the freedom dimension, brother."
  3. "I am Leonard, the spiritual guide of this team."
- Leonard: "Report back to Marcel. We probably won't meet again."

## Back with Marcel
1.
- Marcel: "What the hell was that? That could not have been more conspicuous if we came here in an air balloon."
- (player): "Damn, too many alarms, right? Can we try that again?"
- Miguel: "Get your stupid ass into this boat. We've got a freighter to loot."

2.
- Marcel: "Well, you completed the objective. And managed to murder everyone in your path. Congratulations, Mr. Bond."
- (player): "I was sent to do a task, and I performed it. The style of execution is mine to decide."
- Marcel: "I will decide to proclaim you a major jackass, then. Get in the boat. We have a shipment to capture."

3.
- Marcel: "Nice work tonight, (player). That went smooth as butter."
- (player): "I felt a subtle and non-lethal approach would benefit us in the end."
- Marcel: "My thoughts exactly. I think you will do well here, my man. Let's go steal some barrels."
