- Miguel: "We want to see how you deal with this situation on your own, so you'll be going in alone. We will occupy this place once the coast is clear."
- Miguel: "Pick a weapon and incapacitate the guards any way you like."
- (player):
  1. “Just give me a stick. I'll manage.”
  2. "Hand over the assault rifle. I'll show you faggots how it's done."
  3. "I'll take the darts. No need to kill everyone."
- Miguel:
  1. "Very funny. I'll give you a tazer."
  2. "OK, big man. Don't trip over your huge cojones on the way."
  3. "Good thinking. The non-lethal approach makes us look better in any case."
- Miguel: "We have an informant on the north dock who knows this place inside out."
- Miguel: "If you want a few tips from him, tell him I sent you." 
- Miguel: "Now get moving. Vaya con dios."
