# Mods
## Structure
Resource files will be placed externally in /Textures /Prefabs and so on. There will be a /Mods folder as well, and from there users are able to supplement or replace content in the game.

## Online
There will be community bords for sharing mods, and moderators will test them and include them in an "official" repo to make mods available for download directly from within the game menu
