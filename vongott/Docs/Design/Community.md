## Story
The first chapter will be developed by the core team, the players will then be encouraged to pitch in with suggestions to make up the next chapter

## Structure
Resource files will be precompiled with the project, only to be accessible from within the editor. This is mainly because of a limitation with Unity. Mods will be easy to do from within Unity, but we should develop a way for mods to work without it eventually. This is a stretch goal, though.

## Boards
There will be community boards for discussing and sharing development material, such as story and in-game assets.
