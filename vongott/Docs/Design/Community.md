# Mods
## Community SDK
An SDK will be developed from scratch for creating game content. This will be used in production and as modding tool.
- Conversation editor with support for flags, quests, dialogue strings and dialogue audio
- Quest editor
- Level editor

## Story
The first few chapters will be developed by the core team, the players will then be encouraged to pitch in with suggestions to make up the next chapter

## Structure
Resource files will be placed externally in /Textures /Prefabs and so on. There will be a /Mods folder as well, and from there users are able to supplement or replace content in the game.

## Boards
There will be community boards for sharing mods, and moderators will test them and include them in an "official" repo to make mods available for download directly from within the game menu
