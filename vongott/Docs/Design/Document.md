Weapons, provisions and digital mods can be purchased in shops. The currency is called 'moneys'. Moneys can be found on incapacitated people, in locked containers that require lockpicking and in cash points.

# User interface
## Menu system
The menu system is completely circular. Inspired by mechanical aesthetics of The Matrix, it is an attempt to do better what they tried to accomplish in Deus Ex Invisible War. On clicking a menu item in the outer rim, the cirlce expands and reveals a new page underneath. Halo lights will indicate the active circle.

## Heads Up Display
Displays health and energy in the top right and weapons in the bottom. The weapons interface only pops up if activated via scroll wheel or number keys.

## Enemies
Enemies will walk patrol routes and have a fairly wide vision cone. 

They will have 3 states: casual, cautious and aggressive. Cautious leads to aggressive, if they spot the player. No NPCs outside of the game screen should be able to see the player, unless they're already chasing him.

If they spot dead bodies, they will become cautious.
