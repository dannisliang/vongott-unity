Items 
=====
Items can be found, stolen or purchased throughout the world. They should have short, accurate descriptions in layman's terms. And silly. Silly as hell. The player should be incentivised to look for items because of their usefulness in the world. 

## Interfaces
Readable
- Books
- Newspapers
- Notes

Interactive
- Mobile phones (silly games, text messages)
- Terminals
- Computers

## Trigger items
Some items trigger events, like doors opening and hidden areas being revealed. These items can either be picked up or not, and should be hinted at through riddles and other clues, a la Silent Hill.

## Quest items
Quest items cannot be used by the player, but are instrumental to solving a quest, i.e. bringing an object to a person or destroying it.

## Null objects
The player can pick these objects up and throw them at people, but that is the limit of their functionality.

## Upgrades
The upgrades are like equipment, can be found or purchased.

### Mechanical
Mechanical upgrades are inactive by default and can be activated at the player's convenience. They need to be installed by a professional mechanic, as they replace physical bodyparts of the player, allowing for a lot of customisation. They should have branding names that relate to their purpose (e.g. "Cheetah" for fast legs). When activated, they consume electricity.
