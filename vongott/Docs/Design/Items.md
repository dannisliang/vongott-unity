Items 
=====
Items can be found, stolen or purchased throughout the world. They should have short, accurate descriptions in layman's terms. And silly. Silly as hell. The player should be incentivised to look for items because of their usefulness in the world. 

## Trigger items
Some items trigger events, like doors opening and hidden areas being revealed. These items can either be picked up or not, and should be hinted at through riddles and other clues, a la Silent Hill.

## Quest items
Quest items cannot be used by the player, but are instrumental to solving a quest, i.e. bringing an object to a person or destroying it.

## Null objects
The player can pick these objects up and throw them at people, but that is the limit of their functionality.

## Consumable
The consumable class refers to any item that has immediate effect on the condition of the player.

## Upgrades
The upgrades are like equipment, can be found or purchased.

### Mechanical
Mechanical upgrades need to be installed by a professional mechanic, as they replace physical bodyparts of the player, allowing for a lot of customisation. They should have branding names that relate to their purpose (e.g. "Cheetah" for fast legs). When activated, they consume electricity.

### Biological
Biological upgrades are passive and govern internal properties, such as reflexes and dexterity. They can be installed by the player.

#### Hands  
- Lock picking
- Reload speed
  - The factor with which to multiply the reload speed of any weapon
- Punch
  - A variety of punching attacks with different impact levels

#### Skull 
- Hacking (passive)
  - Interfacing with consoles, cameras and computers without knowing the username and password

### Combinations
Players should be rewarded for combining certain upgrades, such as events triggering.
- REFLEXES + SPEED: Time slows down, but players move around at normal speed
- SPEED + STRENGTH: When running up to an enemy and punching, a special machinima plays
  - Self-fist-five and enemy's head flies off! F*ck yeah!
- PARACHUTE + STRENGTH: The player creates a shockwave when landing
