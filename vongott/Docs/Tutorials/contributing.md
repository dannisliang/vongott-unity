### Getting Vongott locally
You can use <a href="http://msysgit.github.io/">this</a> to download the repository.

If you open Git GUI, there should be an option to create repo from an existing one.
Just use the url https://github.com/mrzapp/vongott.git and save it to some directory.
It will then proceed to download all the files.
When you have edited something, you can then "add" a file, then "commit" your changes to confirm it, and then "push" everything to Github.

### Editing files
The text format used on Github is "markdown". You can either use the plain text syntax <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">here</a> or download a <a href="http://www.texts.io/">friendly editor</a> and it's <a href="http://www.texts.io/support/0004/">export function</a>.
Just save the format as "Github Markdown", and everything should be fine.
