### Emulating the masters
While Unity does provide some built-in skybox functionality, it's only cubemap based, and not quite enough for what we want to do. I decided to emulate the Unreal Engine's camera-based skybox paradigm, and it is now working beautifully.

The skybox also displays in the editor, here with the La Guardia Terminal map
