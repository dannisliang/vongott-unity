### UI
I've decided on a circular UI, as that has always been something I'd like to do. Some of you might think "Oh no, make it stop!", but to that I say "poppycock!". It can work. Seriously. Come on, seriously.
I am essentially aiming to accomplish what they failed to do in DX:IW. These are rough prototypes, but they get the point across.

### Upgrades
The upgrade types are starting to take shape, for instance the "Reflexes" upgrade which essentially slows down time for everything but the player's view controls. I am imagining this as a sort of temporary steroid boost for your brain, allowing it to work up to 10 times as fast. The robot in question here is Robot Kyle from the Unity Asset store, which I am using as a stand-in until we get the character models going. The JC Denton with his arms spread out will probably continue to be a placeholder for everything, because it just looks hilarious.

### Surface editor
Lastly, I have made some significant changes to the surface editor, I'm getting closer to my vision of totally free mesh weaving within the editor.
