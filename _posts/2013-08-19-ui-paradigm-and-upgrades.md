Updates from the second development phase.

<!--more-->

I've decided on a circular UI, as that has always been something I'd like to do. Some of you might think "Oh no, make it stop!", but to that I say "poppycock!". It can work. Seriously. Come on, seriously.

I am essentially aiming to accomplish what they failed to do in DX:IW. These are rough prototypes, and there are some drawing issues courtesy of the latest Unity update, but it gets the idea across.

The upgrade types are starting to take shape, among othres the "Reflexes" upgrade which essentially slows down time for everything but the player's view controls. I am imagining this as a sort of temporary steroid boost for your brain, allowing it to work up to 10 times as fast. The robot in question here is Robot Kyle from the Unity Asset store, which I am using as a stand-in until we get the character models going. The JC Denton with his arms spread will probably continue to be a placeholder for everything, because it just looks hilarious.

Lastly, I have made some significant changes to the surface editor, I'm getting closer to my vision of totally free mesh weaving within the editor.
