### Abandoned La Guardia Flight Terminal
It has been decided that the first map should be an abandoned flight terminal at La Guardia Airport. It will be adjacent to Lebedev's airfield.

Below is a lighting test with some new wall types featuring placeholder textures from the [New Vision](http://www.moddb.com/mods/new-vision) mod. I like it so much, I think I'll ask them if we can use their work in Vongott. It would be rather relevant after all.

There is also a preliminary blueprint design of the terminal [here](https://raw.github.com/mrzapp/vongott/master/vongott/Concept/Maps/1-1_la_guardia_terminal_first_floor.jpg)
