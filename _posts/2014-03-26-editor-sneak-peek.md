I did a quick 'n' dirty video capture of the Vongott Editor.  
  
Features depicted include:

- Main menu
- Map loading
- Inspector menu and tabs
- Conversation node editor
- Prefab browser
- Object transformation

We will put together a more thorough feature walkthrough with narration later, and we'll cover the gameplay parts too, as soon as the La Guardia map has been polished a bit.
