I did a video capture of the Vongott Editor. This is not a feature walkthough by any means, it's just a quick and dirty presentation.  
  
Features shown include:

- Main menu
- Map loading
- Inspector menu and tabs
- Conversation node editor
- Prefab browser
- Object transformation

I will put together a more thorough feature walthgouh with narration later, and we'll cover the gameplay parts too, as soon as I've polished the La Guardia map up a bit.
