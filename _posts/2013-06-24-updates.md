I have spent my time doing my own GUI framework for Unity called OpenGUI, and I have managed to build a pretty capable level editor with an inspector, save/load features, adding prefabs, editing conversations, quests and flags, editing surface vectors, and probably a few more things. The editor is at this point capable of building a coherent, if very rudimentary, action RPG :)

The level shown below was made exclusively with this editor, without using Unity.

The conversation editor and logic is fully functional, apart from playing audio clips.
