### Updates
These are the updates from the first development phase. I have spent my time doing my own GUI framework for Unity called OpenGUI, and I have managed to build a pretty capable level editor with an inspector, save/load features, adding prefabs, editing conversations, quests and flags, editing surface vectors, and probably a few more things. The editor is at this point capable of building a coherent, if very rudimentary, action RPG :)

<a data-lightbox="gallery" href="{{ img_path }}gui.jpg"><img src="{{ img_path }}gui.jpg" /></a>Editor GUI 
<a data-lightbox="gallery" href="{{ img_path }}level.jpg"><img src="{{ img_path }}level.jpg" /></a>This level was made exclusively with this editor, without using Unity.
<a data-lightbox="gallery" href="{{ img_path }}convo.jpg"><img src="{{ img_path }}convo.jpg" /></a>The conversation editor and logic is fully functional, apart from playing audio clips.
