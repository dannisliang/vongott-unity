The editor is shaping up to be an all-round capable tool for stringing together level geometry, prefabs, events, actors and items. An important thing to mention is that I have completely dropped trying to weave mesh and do boolean operations within the editor itself, as it is simply too big a mouthful for now. There are a few proprietary plugins available for Unity to accomplish this, I invested in the popular [GameDraw](http://u3d.as/content/mixed-dimensions/game-draw/2Ey), and while it does perform admirably, it's just not at all good enough. I've written an .obj importer instead, so static level geometry can be created in third party 3d software, which typically is much more capable of such things.

### Updates
These are the updates from the first development phase. I have spent my time doing my own GUI framework for Unity called OpenGUI, and I have managed to build a pretty capable level editor with an inspector, save/load features, adding prefabs, editing conversations, quests and flags, editing surface vectors, and probably a few more things. The editor is at this point capable of building a coherent, if very rudimentary, action RPG :)
